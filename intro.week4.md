Hi there. In the previous section, we wrapped up how to run a project using
Scrum. I introduced you to the day-to-day practices that most Scrum Teams use.
These practices include developing user stories, managing a Product Backlog, and
running Sprints. In this next section, we're going to take an even wider view of
Scrum and Agile. I'll introduce you to how to use Scrum and Agile in your daily
life. I'll help prepare you to apply Agile thinking and methods to both job
interviews and potential work scenarios. These work scenarios will teach you how
to implement Agile to deliver value and achieve your business goals. You'll also
learn some techniques for responding to risks and team dynamics. Finally, I'm
going to wrap up this course on the foundations of Agile by discussing Agile as
it applies to the broader project management discipline. I'll help you figure
out how to use Agile in your next position. Ready for the final stretch of this
Agile journey? Let's go.
