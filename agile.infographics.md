understand Agile values in mobile app development

1. individuals and interactions over processes and tools
   Avi speaks regularly with the baristas at Family Jave to learn how the company's app is working to provide accurate customer orders. Although there is a formal process for baristas to submit issues, Avi values his interactions with them, learning how the app impacts their day-to-day work and collaborating on what updates are important. 

2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
Family Java considers its app to be ever-evolving. Initially, customers could only order drinks, but over time, the company added new features like a rewards program. Avi documents these updates in simple spec sheets for each feature release rather than creating multiple, detailed documents for each new feature request.

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Rather than enter into agreements with market research companies, Avi loves to come into the shop to test features of the app with actual customers. Family Java typically prefers this in-the-moment type of interaction to collect feedback.

4. Responding to change over following a plan
Family Java built a feedback mechanism into its app, but customers prefer to post their opinions on social media instead. Here, customers organically formed a Family Java community online. The company didnâ€™t anticipate this, but now its baristas and project managers frequently join the conversation and respond to feedback, quickly and easily.
