Hi again, and congrats on reaching the end of this course on the foundations of
Agile. We covered a lot of material that I hope you'll find useful to your
growth and effectiveness as a project manager. Throughout this course on the
foundations of Agile, we covered the history of Agile, along with the core Agile
values and principles. We learned all about Scrum and how Scrum Teams work.
Then, in this last section, we explored how to introduce Agile practices to an
organization and how to coach a team through the process. Finally, we checked
out some of the exciting ways that Agile is evolving and how to apply your
knowledge of Agile to your future career in project management. Coming up in the
last and final course of this certification program, you're going to apply
everything you've learned to a brand new project. I'm so excited for you.
